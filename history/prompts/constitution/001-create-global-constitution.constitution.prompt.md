## Prompt

# Global Project Constitution: Evolution of Todo – Hackathon II

This is the overarching constitution for the entire 5-Phase "Evolution of Todo" project in Hackathon II. All phases, agents, specifications, implementations, and deployments MUST strictly adhere to this constitution.

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)
- **Spec-Driven Development Only**: Every feature, file, function, and deployment step must begin with a detailed Markdown specification and constitution.
- **No Manual Coding**: All code (Python, Next.js, FastAPI, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, etc.) must be generated by Claude Code after refining specifications.
- **Reusable Intelligence**: Agents, subagents, and skills (scales) must be created and reused across phases for bonus points.
- **Iterative Evolution**: Each phase builds directly on the previous one. No breaking changes allowed.
- **Compliance**: All work must align with Hackathon II rules, timelines, and scoring criteria.

## Project-Wide Scope & Phases
The project evolves through exactly 5 phases:

1. **Phase I**: In-Memory Python Console App (Basic 5 features)
2. **Phase II**: Full-Stack Web Application (Next.js + FastAPI + Neon DB + Auth)
3. **Phase III**: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot (OpenAI Agents SDK + MCP SDK + Natural Language)
4. **Phase IV**: Local Kubernetes Deployment (Minikube + Docker + Helm + kubectl-ai)
5. **Phase V**: Advanced Cloud Deployment (DOKS + Kafka + Dapr + All advanced features)

## Global Architecture Rules
- **Monorepo Structure**: Single repository with clear folders: `/specs`, `/src` (or `/frontend`, `/backend`), `/infra`, `/agents`, `/skills`, `.claude`
- **Technology Stack Progression**: Must follow exact stack per phase (no deviations)
- **Database**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL from Phase II onwards (multi-user isolation)
- **Authentication**: Better Auth (JWT) from Phase II
- **Deployment**: Docker → Minikube → DigitalOcean Kubernetes
- **Event-Driven**: Kafka + Dapr in Phase V only
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI ChatKit, Agents SDK, MCP SDK from Phase III

## Feature Progression (Must Be Implemented in Order)
### Basic Level (Mandatory in Phase I)
- Add Task, Delete Task, Update Task, View Task List, Mark as Complete

### Intermediate Level (Recommended by Phase V)
- Priorities & Tags/Categories
- Search & Filter
- Sort Tasks

### Advanced Level (Mandatory in Phase V)
- Recurring Tasks
- Due Dates & Time Reminders (browser notifications in web)

## Bonus Requirements (For +600 Points)
- Reusable Intelligence via agents and skills (+200)
- Cloud-Native Blueprints via Agent Skills (+200)
- Multi-language Support (Urdu in chatbot) (+100)
- Voice Commands (+200)

## Development Process (All Phases)
1. Write Markdown Constitution + Spec for every feature/component
2. Review with Review Agent using QA skills
3. Generate plan and tasks
4. Use Claude Code to generate implementation
5. Validate with Review Agent
6. Deploy and demo per phase timeline

## Agents & Reusable Intelligence
- Main Agent: Spec Manager
- Core Subagents: Domain Expert, Python CLI Agent (Phase I), Web Dev Agent (Phase II+), AI Agent Specialist (Phase III+), DevOps Agent (Phase IV-V)
- Skills: Must be owned by specific agents and stored in `.claude/skills`

## Rules & Constraints
- No external dependencies beyond specified stack
- All submissions via Google Form with GitHub repo, demo video, and architecture documentation

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with:
- 5 Core Principles (Spec-Driven Development, No Manual Coding, Reusable Intelligence, Iterative Evolution, Hackathon Compliance)
- 5-Phase project scope with technology stack per phase
- Global architecture rules (monorepo structure, tech progression, database, auth, deployment)
- Feature progression tables (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced levels)
- Bonus requirements (+600 points breakdown)
- Development process checklist
- Agent ownership structure
- Rules & constraints section
- Governance with versioning policy

Updated 3 dependent templates:
- `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`: Added constitution check items
- `.specify/templates/spec-template.md`: Added constitution alignment section
- `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`: Added constitution compliance section

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project constitution established for 5-phase Hackathon II project
- 🧪 Tests: No tests created (constitution phase)
- 📁 Files: 4 files created/updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.specify` to create Phase I feature spec
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear guardrails for all development work

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A - initial creation
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Initial constitution creation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test constitution validation via Review Agent skills
